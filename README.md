ReactiveUI-BingSearch
=====================

This is a sample application that uses ReactiveUI (and Reactive Extensions) to perform searches using the Bing Search API.

To run it, you have to get an "API Key" from http://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/searchweb

Register, get one an run it.

The application will ask you to enter the key when it starts and you are done :)
